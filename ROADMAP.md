# Repository Roadmap

This document outlines the current state of the repository, identifies known gaps, and provides a roadmap for moving forward. It also includes a **repository tree** to track the evolving structure of the project.

---

## Current State

The repository is organized into several key directories, each focusing on a specific aspect of the **Volume Interaction Framework**. Below is a summary of the current state of each directory:

### Framework Overview
- **Status**: The core principles and 5-step interaction process are well-defined. A comedic example (old married couple) has been added to illustrate the concept.
- **Known Gaps**:
  - Add more examples of the 5-step interaction in physics contexts.
  - Expand on how observer-dependence applies to specific physics concepts.

### Physics Concepts
- **Status**: Worded translations of known physics concepts (e.g., mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics) have been reinterpreted through the Volume Interaction Framework.
- **Known Gaps**:
  - Add mathematical resolutions for each concept in the `src` directory.
  - Include more examples of volume interactions in specific physics problems.

### Facility and Machine Concepts
- **Status**: Workflow notation for facilities and machines has been established, with an example waste facility provided.
- **Known Gaps**:
  - Develop more detailed workflow notations for different types of facilities and machines.
  - Add examples of how degradation factors apply to facility workflows.

### Experimental Designs
- **Status**: A speed of light experiment has been proposed but not fully developed.
- **Known Gaps**:
  - Fully develop the speed of light experiment, including theoretical and practical considerations.
  - Add more experimental designs to test the Volume Interaction Framework.

**Note**: All markdown documents listed as **complete** are in a settled state but can always be revisited. They are not currently being actively worked on by me.

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Examples**: Add more examples and case studies to illustrate the framework in action.
2. **Mathematical Resolutions**: Develop mathematical resolutions for the concepts in the `src` directory.
3. **Cross-Reference Sections**: Link related sections (e.g., `Framework_Overview`, `Physics_Concepts`, `Facility_or_Machine_Concepts`) to create a cohesive narrative.
4. **Collaborate**: Invite contributions from others to fill gaps and expand the framework.
