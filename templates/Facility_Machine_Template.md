## 1. Facility Workflow Skeleton Notation ##
*1.1 - Facility Name*
*1.2 - Facility General Concept Description *

## 2. Facility Components or Units ##
Each unit has a number and a name 
*2.? - name / description*

## 3. Types of connections ##
Each unit connection type notated by number within parathesis between matching open and close dash pairs.  A dash open and a dash close.  A dash open or a double dash close.  A placeholder type will be by default 3..
*3.? - name / description*
3.. - placeholder for connection needed but not defined yet

## 4. Component or unit connections ##

Each unit connection notated by matching open and closing dashes.  To signal modular entry or exit points the modular input would signal with a dash followed by a question mark.  To end the current modular entry point close with a dash followed by a question mark.  No workflow can have a modular entry that is linked as an exit to a point before the entry.  This would need to have the earlier point notated within a workflow that has a linear flow and natural endpoint.  Said notation of workflow would bloat but that bloat is needed to consider degredation while all workflow must have a begginning and end. Each use of a modular input would link to a specific notation of what is being considered within the workflow thus act as a branch not a loop.
To signal exit from workflow a connection of dash question mark dash will exit workflow. Workflow notation has a max limit of unit combinations configurable while respecting limits set within any computational limits.
