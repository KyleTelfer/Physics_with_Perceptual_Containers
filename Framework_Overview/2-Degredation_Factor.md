### 2. Reframing Degradation as a Computational Threshold

In this framework, the term **degradation** is specifically a **computational threshold** used to limit calculations, rather than a description of the physical reality of the volume itself. This distinction is crucial for understanding how **closed volumes** function in the framework.

---

#### 2.1. Degradation as a Computational Threshold

- **Degradation factor (\( D \))**: A measure of the loss of precision in the mathematical definition of a closed volume.
- **Threshold for computation**: When \( D \) falls below a certain threshold (e.g., \( D < 0.5 \)), the calculation is no longer reliable or meaningful.
- **Not about physical change**: Degradation does not describe the physical degradation of the volume itself. Instead, it reflects the **loss of integrity** in the volume's mathematical definition as calculations progress.

---

#### 2.2. Closing a Volume for Calculation

- **Closed volumes are mathematical abstractions**: When you close a volume for a specific calculation, you assume it is isolated and energy is conserved.
- **Temporary assumption**: This assumption is only valid for the duration of the calculation.
- **Degradation occurs as calculations progress**: Each step in the calculation introduces uncertainties or external references, reducing the integrity of the closed volume’s definition.

---

#### 2.3. Durational Resolution and Degradation

- **Durational resolution**: As time progresses (or as calculations progress), the **definition of the closed volume** degrades due to:
  - **External references**: Introducing open volumes or measuring volumes.
  - **Internal uncertainties**: Entropic variables (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)) that represent unobserved interactions.
- **Degradation is not about physical change**: It only limits the **mathematical precision** of the volume’s definition.

---

#### 2.4. Volume Growth and Change in Reality

- **Volumes are dynamic**: While the **mathematical definition** of the volume degrades during calculations, the **physical volume** can grow, shrink, or change in reality.
- **Degradation does not constrain physical change**: It only limits the computational precision of the volume’s definition.
- **Re-defining volumes**: After a calculation, the volume can be redefined to reflect its new state, even if its previous definition has degraded.

---

#### 2.5. Reframing Degradation in the Framework

To reflect this understanding, we can reframe **degradation** in the framework as follows:

##### 2.5.1 Degradation as a Computational Threshold**
- **Degradation factor (\( D \))**: A measure of the loss of precision in the mathematical definition of a closed volume.
- **Threshold for computation**: When \( D \) falls below a certain threshold (e.g., \( D < 0.5 \)), the calculation is no longer reliable.

##### 2.5.2 Volume Dynamics in Reality**
- **Volumes can grow or change**: The physical volume is not constrained by degradation.
- **Re-defining volumes**: After a calculation, the volume can be redefined to reflect its new state, even if its previous definition has degraded.

#### 2.6. Example: Degradation as a Computational Threshold**

Let’s revisit the collision example and apply this reframed understanding of degradation.

##### **Scenario**
Two objects, Object A (\( V_A \)) and Object B (\( V_B \)), collide elastically. The system (\( V_{\text{system}} \)) is treated as a closed volume for the calculation, but the calculation references a **measuring volume** (\( V_{\text{measure}} \)) to determine velocities. Additionally, the closed volume has an entropic variable \( V_{\text{entropic}} = 0.2 \).

##### **Step 1: Define the Volumes**
1. **Object A (\( V_A \))**:
   - Mass: \( m_A = 2 \, \text{kg} \)
   - Initial Velocity: \( v_{A, \text{initial}} = 3 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Volume: Closed

2. **Object B (\( V_B \))**:
   - Mass: \( m_B = 3 \, \text{kg} \)
   - Initial Velocity: \( v_{B, \text{initial}} = -2 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Volume: Closed

3. **System Volume (\( V_{\text{system}} \))**:
   - Combines \( V_A \) and \( V_B \).
   - Initially treated as a closed volume with \( D = 1 \).

4. **Measuring Volume (\( V_{\text{measure}} \))**:
   - Used to measure velocities and energies.
   - Open volume (introduces degradation).

5. **Entropic Variable (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \))**:
   - Represents unobserved interactions within the closed volume.
   - \( V_{\text{entropic}} = 0.2 \).

##### **Step 2: Apply Degradation as a Computational Threshold**
1. **Degradation Factor**:
   - Let \( k = 0.1 \) (10% degradation per reference to \( V_{\text{measure}} \)).
   - The calculation references \( V_{\text{measure}} \) 3 times.
   - The entropic variable \( V_{\text{entropic}} = 0.2 \).

   The degradation factor \( D \) is:
   \[
   D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}}) = 1 - (0.1 \cdot 3 + 0.2) = 1 - (0.3 + 0.2) = 0.5
   \]

2. **Threshold for Computation**:
   - If \( D < 0.5 \), the calculation is no longer reliable.
   - In this case, \( D = 0.5 \), so the calculation is at the threshold of reliability.

##### **Step 3: Adjust the Final Results**
1. **Final Velocities Without Degradation**:
   - From the previous calculation:
     \[
     v_{A, \text{final}} = -3 \, \text{m/s}, \quad v_{B, \text{final}} = 2 \, \text{m/s}
     \]

2. **Adjust for Degradation**:
   - Multiply the final velocities by the degradation factor \( D \):
     \[
     v_{A, \text{final, degraded}} = v_{A, \text{final}} \cdot D = -3 \cdot 0.5 = -1.5 \, \text{m/s}
     \]
     \[
     v_{B, \text{final, degraded}} = v_{B, \text{final}} \cdot D = 2 \cdot 0.5 = 1.0 \, \text{m/s}
     \]

##### **Step 4: Interpret the Degraded Results**
1. **First-Person Perspective (\( V_me \))**:
   - The observed velocities are reduced due to degradation, but the physical volumes can still grow or change.
2. **Second-Person Perspective (\( V_you \))**:
   - The observed velocities of the other volume are also reduced, reflecting the computational threshold imposed by degradation.
3. **Third-Person Perspective (\( V \))**:
   - The absolute velocities are reduced, reflecting the system-level impact of degradation.
   
#### 2.7. Conclusion

By reframing **degradation** as a **computational threshold**, the framework becomes more precise and aligned with its intended purpose. This approach acknowledges that:
- **Closed volumes are mathematical abstractions**: They are used for calculations but are not physically constrained by degradation.
- **Degradation limits computation**: It acts as a threshold to ensure the reliability of calculations.
- **Volumes can grow and change**: The physical reality of volumes is independent of their mathematical degradation.
