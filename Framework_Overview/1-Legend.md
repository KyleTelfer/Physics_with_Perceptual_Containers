### Framework Overview ###

I Kyle Telfer, a self-taught individual exploring physics through a structured, iterative process I call the 5-step interaction: perception > interpretation > communication > interpretation > perception. With the help of AI platforms, I’m documenting and organizing known physics principles to better understand my own gaps in knowledge. My goal is to build a framework that helps me—and potentially others—navigate complex ideas by respecting observed data points and existing knowledge, without overextending their implications. This is an ongoing, evolving process, and I hope that by collaborating with others, this framework can grow into something that benefits not just me, but anyone who finds themselves grappling with similar questions.

####Core Priciples####
*Volume Interactions: Forces and interactions are reinterpreted as interactions between volumes.
*Observer-Dependence: Measurements depend on the observer’s perspective. 
*Closed vs. Open Volumes:
*Closed Volume: A volume where energy is conserved (no external energy transfer).
*Open Volume: A volume where energy is not conserved or no energy can enter or exit a closed volume unless expressed as an interaction of two closed volumes within the theoretically fundamental 3d Space volume(external energy transfer occurs).   
*Person Notation:* 
*First-Person POV: Describes the volume from the perspective of being the volume itself.*
*Second-Person POV: Describes another volume from an external perspective.*
*Third-Person POV**: Describes both volumes from an objective, external perspective.*

# 3D Space #
This is meant to try and understand my personal understanding of how I organize 3d space itself within my perception.  I am teaching myself as much as I can about so many things but run into many issues with the order of which things are traditionally tought as well as moving past data points being referenced in places my personal organization equates to unlike conditions.  This head section is a beginning but seems I need to start with volume and work with that and sub sections within that.  I may not need this header section when done but leaving a space for unknown.  The section organization is much influx due to this being a best effort to organize thoughts and document data point problems so I can look to understand what I do not.  I may reorder or move information to a better representation but I am doing my personal best to not include incorrect thoughts or thoughts that have undocumented thresholds without explaination.  This 3d Space section is what I am treating as a open volume to which volume interactions happen but with no limits mass or energy can not be calculated.

# Volume #

Volume is defined as a region within 3D space that can be either an open system or a closed system.  The use of an open volume would indicate theoretical concepts that would always be inside the 3d space volume unless otherwise stated.  The use of multiple independent closed volumes to make comparisons is allowed but consider each value compared has to respect the defined properties of each volume.  This allows for comparison but the need to denote unequal conditions. Things to consider are a volume open or closed does not have to be physical, it could be an energy source propigating 3d space.  This would also include volumes that would not be whole within our current observation but also that concept would automatically include 3d Space theoretical open volume and therfore be within a purely thought space concept to which can not be experimented with.

** Property Variables **
*1. Point of Origin - one common point within volume
*2. Scale of measurement - Scale or units would all be bound to the point of origin upon need to calculate values. -Note this would indicate a relativity difference when a volume is within another volume 
*3. Boundries - The limit or skin of the volume itself. - Note volumes can have physical shapes like containers that do not influence what is within but can be evaluated as two volumes interacting with much math
*4. Duration resolution - this is a common interval that all duration calculations would respect tied to the volume. 
*5. Mass - can only be calculated with a closed volume with required definitions of 1,2,3,4
*6. Energy - can be quantified only with a closed volume tied to mass of the same closed volume
*7. Density - can be quantified only with a closed volume tied to the mass of the same closed volume
*8. Gravity: This is an attraction to the net center of mass of a volume, whose strength (amplitude) decreases with the square of the distance from that center in a spherically symmetric manner. When evaluating open volumes, interactions with unknown or external masses may influence the gravitational field, and each mass concentration contributes its own spherically symmetric field.
*9. Entropic Variables - In the framework, **closed volumes** are systems where energy is conserved, and no external energy transfer occurs. However, any reference to an **open volume**, **theoretical volume**, or **measuring volume** within a calculation introduces potential degradation of the closed volume's integrity. This degradation is further influenced by **entropic variables** (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)), which represent the unobserved or undefined interactions within the closed volume itself.

1. Absolute Volume (Third-Person):
   - Formula: V = x * y * z

2. First-Person Volume (V_me):
   - Formula: V_me = (x_me * y_me) * z_inferred

3. Second-Person Volume (V_you):
   - Formula: V_you = (x_you * y_you) * z_measured 
   
==== Notes ====
- An observers perception and an observers observance are not equal so all measurements taken to define a volume would be limitted to the context of an open volume viewing an other open volume that is in process of being closed or defined for calculation.  This is the at the heart of battle between experimental and theoretical.

***Noted Issue - Mass and Density have a dependancy to each other to be defined so one is needed to define the other.  This indicates they are relative to each other with pure definition on yet another unknown.

#Volumes within perception#
Volume interactions are a way for me to compartmentalize interactions but this framework is an attempt to respect the need to look at things in a way to understand something specific while respecting the interactions of reality.  So Closing a volume is a theoretical way to define specific conditions and follow interactions but this in no way is useful to simulate a situation for a concept of predictability.  Many great works are based within the human experience and thus explain many results within this experience.  I view many constants defined as great but limited to the volume they are computed within.

#Scope of a Closed Volume #
Once a closed volume is defined those definitions can be used for calculations but after any external interaction those definitions would not be considered accurate.  For purposes of comparison they may be valuable but concidering any closed volume as existing in a closed state would be incorrect as everything should account for the unobserved as a possible interaction.

# Open Volume or Partial Volume definitions such as a measuring volume #
As all closed volume energy's are within this theoretical framework to be accounted for the use of entropic variables account for theoretical vs practical variance and other unknowns.  The need to partially define a volume to incorporate specific useful computation for any given need the use of these are both encouraged but need to respect many variables lead to entropic variables through variable definitions themselves.  So given a specific set of experimental needs one would define a measuring volume to enclose the closed volume you are calculating to better control the results and expediate the results for said calculation while respecting the entropic and degredation variables of both measuring volume and closed volume. 

# Choas theory and randomness #
This is an important distinction within volume interactions as being reductive or isolating in nature.  Within this framework the ability to close or define two volumes to do static calculations to understand interactions violates variables within the definitions of the volumes themselves.  Durational resolution deltas or time is the most prominant.  The computation duration needed to predict one square meter of interactions of atomic resolution would violate the durational resolution of each atmoic closed volume itself.  So the use of partially open volumes or measuring volumes to do bigger thinking with less computational burden is needed.   So chaos and randomness is needed to do bigger things even though the randomness might not be random on a micro scale the macro respresentation is random.  This equates to how the micro-particle volume for flow mechanics was needed but the application of chaos or randomness would be the mathmatical representation of the micro-particle solution being used within the flow mechanic system.

# Elements #
The foundation for all physical things.  In the most broad terms to me each element is possibly a stable mass energy threshold to which all foundations of physical material within a volume is wholely notable.

# Micro-particle volumes to evaluate flow dynamics #
Once a system is closed and defined that is intended for flow evaluation and that defined state includes a fully saturated volume you can add a pair of theoretical micro-particle volumes.  These volumes have to have the opposite energy potential from the closed volume not each other.  This way you can evaluate saturated flow within the closed volume without an energy conservation issue.  Note - the micro-particle input and outputs would not be limited to attachment of the closed volume.

With the creation of micro-particle volumes the flow evaluation of the closed volume would not be limited to saturated systems.  The theoretical volume has energy input and output.  This input and output has needed defined properties to evaluate the closed volume.  The reason for energy input to be opposite the output relative to the closed volume is the closed volume would seek equilibrium once saturated.  If your evaluating a flow that is meant to redistribute energy the theoretical energy in and out do not supply the energy to run the evaluation.

# Entropy #
I have issue with Entropy myself.  So conceptually it equates to unobserved interactions or unobserved properties upon closing a volume. To me Entropy is used due to comparing volumes with unlike undocumented conditions.  So within a sterdy conceptual framework the only Entropic values should fall to the not observed and highlight limitations within experimental conversion from theoretical models.

# Duration Resolution between unlike volumes #
To work on durational resolution issues between unlike volumes you would need a perceived stable common point.  Any values would be only theoretical.  For this I might suggest the cosmic microwave background values.  That would be a backdrop large enough for what we see.  The CMB coupled to the Kelvin scale would allow for a theoretical base conversion to durational resolution in regards to energies within differential volumes.

#Formal Definition of Weight#
As an example of open and closed volume interactions. Weight is the **differential force** experienced due to the interaction between two volumes with mass properties, mediated by a net gravitational field. The gravitational field influences the interaction between the volumes to provide a measurement of weight, but the **volume properties** of each gravitational field interacting are irrelevant to the field on the two masses being measured as the measurement is merely a differential between two closed volumes within the measuring volume.

#Mathematical Representation#
The weight (W) of an object can be expressed as: \(W = (m_volumebeingweighed * g_measuringvolume) - (m_volumebeingweighedagainst * g_measuringvolume))

- W is the weight
- m_ is the mass specified.
- g_ is the gravity calculated by the measuring mass
 
# Energy Transfer #
1. Kinetic Energy Transfer
Definition: Kinetic energy transfer occurs through interactions between two closed volumes.  This is either within a third volume or within the theoretical 3d space open volume.

Mechanism: The interaction (e.g., force, collision) between the two closed volumes results in the transfer of kinetic energy.

Key Idea: The energy transfer is mediated by the measuring volume, which provides the context for observing the interaction.

2. Potential Energy Transfer
Definition: Potential energy transfer occurs when a closed system is redefined, which can include the separation of the volume into multiple volumes.

Mechanism: The redefinition of the system (e.g., splitting a volume, changing its configuration) results in the transfer or transformation of potential energy.

Key Idea: Potential energy is tied to the configuration or position of volumes within a system, and changes in this configuration lead to energy transfer.

# Charge or Energy #
This to me is a volume effect that is the same mathmatically as gravity in description but raw source may be very different.  The volume charge would be a net total from all calculated volumes within.  Which is to say volumes within need definition to be considered within energy density propigation.

# Magnetic Force #
For me in words a magnetic field is merely an extension of a closed volume past a physical boundary due to the net charge of composition within demonstrating a attraction or repulsion force depending on the net charge state of the volume as a whole.

# Induction # 
So all this is interesting but perceptually in words it is much simpler.  To me induction is only the kinetic energy transferred by one volumes magnetic field entering a second volume.  -- This would include two volumes that exhibit magnetic fields beyond physical boundary and one magnetic field entering physical volumes who have conducting materials.

# Thermodynamics # 
So issue with Zeroth law.  So to me Zeroth law would be like two seperate closed volumes in equilibrium with a third closed volume would remain in equilibrium if the two seperate closed volumes do not interact.

# Heat transfer terms #
So in my perception I would have Conduction as a thermal value for elastic energy transfer within a closed volume.  Convection would be the elastic delta between two volumes in contact.  Radiation would be elastic calculations between two volumes mediated by a third volume.

# Time between independent Closed Volumes #
By using the Kelvin scale and Cosmic Microwave background Kelvin temperature you can make a common reference point for possible durational resolution issues

# Energy Transfer Between Closed Volumes #
a. Closed Systems and Energy Transfer
In your framework, a closed system is a volume with well-defined boundaries and properties (e.g., energy, temperature, durational resolution).  When energy is transferred between two closed systems (V1V1 and V2V2), the properties of both systems change:

The energy of V1V1 decreases, while the energy of V2V2 increases.

The temperature, durational resolution, and other properties of V1V1 and V2V2
may also change as a result of the energy transfer.

b. Redefining Closed Systems After Energy Transfer
After energy is transferred, the closed systems (V1V1 and V2V2) are no longer in their initial states. This means that any calculations based on their initial properties (e.g., energy, temperature, durational resolution) are no longer valid.

To continue working with V1V1 and V2V2, they must be redefined based on their new properties after the energy transfer.

c. Observer-Dependence of Energy Transfer
The perception of energy transfer can vary depending on the observer’s perspective (first-person, second-person, third-person). For example:

A first-person observer within V1V1 might perceive the energy transfer as a loss of energy.

A second-person observer within V2V2 might perceive the same energy transfer as a gain of energy.

A third-person observer outside the system might perceive the energy transfer as a redistribution of energy between V1V1 and V2V2.

# Closed Volume Degradation Relative to Entropic Variables

## Refined Concept: Degradation and Entropy

In the framework, **closed volumes** are systems where energy is conserved, and no external energy transfer occurs. However, any reference to an **open volume**, **theoretical volume**, or **measuring volume** within a calculation introduces potential degradation of the closed volume's integrity. This degradation is further influenced by **entropic variables** (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)), which represent the unobserved or undefined interactions within the closed volume itself.

The mathematical representation of degradation relative to entropic variables captures the essence of this concept more effectively than words alone. It quantifies the cumulative impact of external references and internal uncertainties, providing a clear and precise way to adjust calculations for real-world complexities.

### Inverse square root ###
Note that the use of squared functions outside perceptual context may hide the need to consider the 3d perception in regards to any interaction.  The inverse square root of a sphere has value from a point of origin to which needs to be defined when considering any vector interaction of a closed volume system.

3. Third-Person Notation (Observer-Independent):
   - Describes properties in an absolute sense.
   - Example: v (velocity in an absolute sense)

### Notes ###
- This notation system accounts for the existence of relativity issues but does not define them.
- For relativistic contexts, additional formulas and considerations are needed.

### Addition to Legend: Mapping Mathematical Branches to Three-Person Notation ###

#### 1. Algebra
- **First-Person (Observer-Dependent)**: 
  - Algebra is used to describe relationships between variables from the observer’s perspective.
  - Example: Solving for x in F = m * a where F, m, and a are measured by the observer.
- **Second-Person (Observer-Dependent)**:
  - Algebra is used to describe relationships between variables from another observer’s perspective.
  - Example: Solving for x in F_you = m_you * a_you.
- **Third-Person (Observer-Independent)**:
  - Algebra is used to describe absolute relationships between variables.
  - Example: Solving for x in F = m * a where F, m, and a are considered invariant.

#### 2. Calculus
- **First-Person (Observer-Dependent)**:
  - Calculus is used to describe rates of change (derivatives) and accumulations (integrals) from the observer’s perspective.
  - Example: Calculating dx_me/dt (velocity as measured by the observer).
- **Second-Person (Observer-Dependent)**:
  - Calculus is used to describe rates of change and accumulations from another observer’s perspective.
  - Example: Calculating dx_you/dt (velocity as measured by another observer).
- **Third-Person (Observer-Independent)**:
  - Calculus is used to describe absolute rates of change and accumulations.
  - Example: Calculating dx/dt (velocity in an absolute sense).

#### 3. Geometry
- **First-Person (Observer-Dependent)**:

  - Example: Calculating the angle theta_me between two lines as measured by the observer.
- **Second-Person (Observer-Dependent)**:
  - Geometry is used to describe shapes, angles, and distances from another observer’s perspective.
  - Example: Calculating the angle theta_you between two lines as measured by another observer.
- **Third-Person (Observer-Independent)**:

  - Example: Calculating the angle theta between two lines in an absolute sense.

#### 4. Linear Algebra
- **First-Person (Observer-Dependent)**:
  - Linear algebra is used to describe vector spaces, transformations, and systems of equations from the observer’s perspective.
  - Example: Solving a system of equations A_me * x_me = b_me.

  - Example: Solving d^2x/dt^2 + k * x = 0.

### Key Notes ###
1. **Limitations of Mathematical Branches**:
   - Each branch of math is limited by the context in which it is applied. For example:
     - Algebra cannot directly describe continuous change (this requires calculus).
     - Geometry cannot directly describe rates of change (this requires calculus or differential equations).
   - By mapping math branches to your three-person notation, you can ensure that the appropriate tools are used for the appropriate context.

2. **Observer-Dependence**:
   - Mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena may vary depending on the observer’s perspective. For example:
     - A first-person derivative (dx_me/dt) may differ from a second-person derivative (dx_you/dt) due to relative motion or differing measurement techniques.
   - The third-person description (dx/dt) represents an absolute or invariant quantity.

3. **Invariance in Third-Person Notation**:
   - Third-person notation is used to describe quantities that are independent of the observer. These quantities often represent fundamental physical laws or constants (e.g., the speed of light c, gravitational constant G).
