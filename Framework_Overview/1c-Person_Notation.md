# Person Notation in Container Interaction Framework

## First-Person POV
- **You are the container**: Describes the container from the perspective of being the container itself.
- Example: `v_me = 5.0` (Velocity of the container).

## Second-Person POV
- **You are describing the other container**: Describes another container from an external perspective.
- Example: `v_you = 3.0` (Velocity of the other container).

## Third-Person POV
- **You are describing both containers**: Describes both containers from an objective, external perspective.
- Example: `v = 4.0` (Velocity of both containers).
