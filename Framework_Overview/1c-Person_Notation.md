# Person Notation in Volume Interaction Framework

## First-Person POV
- **You are the volume**: Describes the volume from the perspective of being the volume itself.
- Example: `v_me = 5.0` (Velocity of the volume).

## Second-Person POV
- **You are describing the other volume**: Describes another volume from an external perspective.
- Example: `v_you = 3.0` (Velocity of the other volume).

## Third-Person POV
- **You are describing both volumes**: Describes both volumes from an objective, external perspective.
- Example: `v = 4.0` (Velocity of both volumes).
