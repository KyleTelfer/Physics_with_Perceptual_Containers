# Self-Sustaining Submerged High-Pressure Hydrogen & Oxygen Gas Production Facility

## 1. Facility Overview

### 1.1 Facility Name:
**Self-Sustaining Submerged High-Pressure Hydrogen & Oxygen Gas Production Facility**

### 1.2 Facility General Concept Description:
This facility produces hydrogen and oxygen gases through a **submerged high-pressure dry cell electrolysis unit** operating at **500–1000 psi**. The submerged design ensures equal pressure inside and outside the cell, preventing membrane strain and maintaining stable **H₂ and O₂ outputs**. The high-pressure gases are used to generate electricity, which is fed back into the system to reduce external energy requirements. The gases are then reduced to a usable distribution pressure (100–200 psi) and sent to storage or distribution systems.
