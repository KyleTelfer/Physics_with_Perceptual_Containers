# Facility and Machine Concepts

## Description
This directory contains documentation and notation for facility and machine workflows within the **Volume Interaction Framework**. Each file describes a specific facility or machine concept, including its components, connections, and workflow notation.

## Key Concepts
- **Volume Interactions**: How facility and machine workflows are represented as interactions between volumes.
- **Degradation Factors**: How computational thresholds are applied in facility workflows.
- **Observer-Dependence**: How different observer perspectives influence the design and analysis of facilities and machines.

## Directory Structure
- **Facility_Skeleton_Hydrogen_Oxygen.md**: A skeleton notation for a hydrogen-oxygen facility.
- **Facility_Workflow_Skeleton_Notation.md**: A general notation for facility workflows.

## How to Use This Directory
1. **Start with Facility_Workflow_Skeleton_Notation.md**: Understand the general notation for facility workflows.
2. **Explore Specific Facilities**: Navigate to specific facility files (e.g., Facility_Skeleton_Hydrogen_Oxygen.md) to see how the notation is applied.
3. **Cross-Reference with Physics Concepts**: The physics concepts behind these workflows can be found in the [Physics Concepts](../Physics_Concepts) directory.
