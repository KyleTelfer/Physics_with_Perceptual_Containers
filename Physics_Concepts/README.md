# Physics Concepts in the Container Interaction Framework

## Description
This directory contains worded translations of known physics concepts reinterpreted through the lens of the **container Interaction Framework**. Each file explores a specific area of physics (e.g., mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics) and describes how traditional concepts are reimagined using **container interactions**, **degradation factors**, and **observer-dependent measurements**.

## Key Concepts
- **container Definitions**: containers are regions of 3D space that can be open or closed, with properties like mass, energy, and density.
- **Degradation Factors**: A computational threshold that accounts for uncertainties and unobserved interactions within closed containers.
- **Observer-Dependent Measurements**: Measurements depend on the observer's perspective (first-person, second-person, third-person).

## Directory Structure
- **3-Mechanics.md**: Reinterprets Newton's Laws of Motion using container interactions.
- **4-Waves_and_Optics.md**: Describes waveforms as energy transfers between containers.
- **5-Electromagnetism.md**: Reimagines electric and magnetic fields as extensions of closed containers.
- **6-Thermodynamics.md**: Reinterprets heat transfer and entropy as interactions between thermal containers.
- **7-Fluid_Mechanics.md**: Describes fluid flow as interactions between dynamic containers.
- **8-Relativity.md**: Reinterprets relativistic effects using container interactions.
- **9-Quantum_Mechanics.md**: Describes wavefunctions as closed containers containing probabilistic states.
- **10-Nuclear_and_Particle_Physics.md**: Reinterprets nuclear reactions and particle interactions as container dynamics.
- **11-Cosmology.md**: Applies the framework to cosmological phenomena like the Big Bang, dark matter, and dark energy.

## How to Use This Directory
1. **Start with the Framework Overview**: If you're new to the container Interaction Framework, begin with the [Framework Overview](../Framework_Overview/1-Legend.md) to understand the core principles and notation.
2. **Explore Specific Concepts**: Navigate to the physics concept you're interested in (e.g., mechanics, electromagnetism) to see how it's reinterpreted in the framework.
3. **Cross-Reference with Mathematics**: The mathematical resolution of these concepts can be found in the [src](../src) directory or other parts of the repository.
