## 8. Relativity

### 8.1. Special Relativity
- **Framework Translation**: Special relativity describes how **kinetic energy propagation** through **low-mass open volumes** is affected by high speeds.
- **Key Idea**: Highlights the **limitations of variables** (e.g., time, length) when dealing with high-speed energy propagation.

### 8.2. General Relativity
- **Framework Translation**: General relativity describes how **mass influences energy propagation** in the **3D space open volume**, curving spacetime and affecting energy distribution.
- **Key Idea**: Mass (a property of closed volumes) curves spacetime, influencing energy propagation and creating observable effects like gravitational lensing.

### 8.3. Time Dilation and Length Contraction
- **Framework Translation**: Time dilation and length contraction are reinterpreted as **observer-dependent effects** caused by relative motion and energy distribution.
- **Key Idea**: The perception of time and length depends on the **observer’s perspective** and the relative energy distribution between volumes.

### 8.4. Mass-Energy Equivalence (\( E = mc² \))
- **Traditional View**: \( E = mc² \) assumes a fixed relationship between mass and energy, with \( c² \) as a constant conversion factor.
- **Framework Translation**: The relationship between mass and energy is **dynamic**, with **percent modifiers** applied to both \( m \) and \( c² \) to account for the **interaction between wavelength wholeness** and **spacetime density**.
  \[
  E = (\alpha \cdot m) \cdot (\beta \cdot c^2)
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \alpha \): Mass modifier, accounting for the interaction between radiation and mass.
  - \( \beta \): Spacetime modifier, accounting for the interaction between radiation and spacetime density.

#### 8.4.1. Percent Modifiers and Their Meaning
- **Mass Modifier (\( \alpha \))**: Adjusts the effective mass based on the wavelength wholeness and mass density.
- **Spacetime Modifier (\( \beta \))**: Adjusts the effective speed of light based on the wavelength wholeness and spacetime density.

#### 8.4.2. Implications for Energy Propagation
- **Higher-Energy Radiation**: Larger \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), allowing the radiation to **violate the threshold** of spacetime density and interact selectively with mass.
- **Lower-Energy Radiation**: Smaller \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), causing the radiation to adhere more closely to the local propagation speed of spacetime.

#### 8.4.3. Example: X-Ray Imaging with Modified \( E = mc² \)
- **Scenario**: X-rays interact with bones and soft tissues based on the **mass modifier (\( \alpha \))** and propagate through spacetime based on the **spacetime modifier (\( \beta \))**.

### 8.5. Reflection on Relativity in the Framework
- **Dynamic Mass-Energy Equivalence**: The relationship between mass and energy becomes **dynamic**, with percent modifiers accounting for the interaction between radiation, mass, and spacetime.
- **Wavelength Wholeness**: The **wavelength wholeness** of the radiation plays a key role in determining the percent modifiers, influencing both the interaction with mass and the propagation through spacetime.
- **Spacetime Density**: The **spacetime density** governs how efficiently radiation propagates through the background medium, with higher-energy radiation (like X-rays) violating the threshold and interacting selectively with mass.
