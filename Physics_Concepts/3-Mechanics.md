##Newtonian Mechanics##

### 3.1. Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia)###
Traditional Formula:
An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.

Your Framework’s Interpretation:
An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external volume interaction.

Explanation:
In your framework, forces are reinterpreted as interactions between volumes. The “external volume interaction” represents the influence of one volume on another, replacing the traditional concept of force.
The use of an empty 3d space open volume is to ensure energy is assigned a space for unobserved transfer or non spacial interactions.

Example:

First-Person Perspective (V_me): An object at rest in your observed volume remains at rest unless another volume interacts with it.

Third-Person Perspective (V): An object in an absolute volume remains in uniform motion unless an external volume interaction occurs.

### 3.2. Newton’s Second Law###
Traditional Formula: F = m * a

Where:
F = Force
m = Mass
a = Acceleration

Your Framework’s Interpretation:
 1st person - V_me_delta = m_me * a_me
 2nd person - V_you_delta = m_you * a_you
 3rd person - (V_me_delta * V_you_delta)/2 = ((m_me * m_you)/2)*((a_me * a_you)/2)
 
Where:
  V_delta = Volume interaction (replaces force)
  m_ = mass of specific volume at duration of definition 
  a_ = acceleration of specific volume at duration of definition
  
  Note 3rd person interaction needs both volumes within to be in the same closed volume or theoretical equivalent is assumed to correct for differential environment during definition.
  
Example:

First-Person Perspective (V_me): The acceleration of a volume in your observed system is proportional to the interaction between it and another volume.

Third-Person Perspective (V): The absolute acceleration of a volume is determined by the net interaction between volumes in the system.

### 3.3. Newton’s Third Law###

Traditional Formula:
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Your Framework’s Interpretation:
For every volume interaction, the point of interaction is shared between the volumes and the volume properties determine how much energy is sent back into each volume independently.  This interaction within an accurate framework will result in any cascading calculations to only require focus on the closed volume of interest. 

Explanation:
In your framework, the interaction between volumes is shared, but the resulting energy distribution depends on the properties of each volume (e.g., mass, density).

Example:

First-Person Perspective (V_me): When two volumes interact, the energy distribution is observed from your perspective.

Third-Person Perspective (V): The absolute energy distribution between volumes is independent of the observer.

### 3.4. Concervation of Energy ###

**Original Statement**:  
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

**Your Framework’s Interpretation**:  
The Conservation of Energy defines whether a volume is **closed** or **open**:  
- **Closed Volume (\( V_{closed} \))**: A volume where energy is conserved (no external energy transfer).  
- **Open Volume (\( V_{open} \))**: A volume where energy is not conserved (external energy transfer occurs).

### 3.5. Concervation of Momentum ###

**Original Statement**:  
The total momentum of a closed system remains constant unless acted upon by an external force.

**Your Framework’s Interpretation**:  
The total momentum of a **closed volume** remains constant within the measured volume unless:  
1. An **external volume interaction** occurs.  
2. The **measured volume properties** change relative to the closed volume.  
Momentum is a property of volumes and their motion, and its conservation depends on whether the volume is closed or open.

### 3.6. Conservation of Angular Momentum###

**Original Statement**:  
The total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant unless acted upon by an external torque.

**Your Framework’s Interpretation**:  
The total angular momentum of a **closed volume** remains constant within the measured volume unless:  
1. An **external volume interaction (torque)** occurs.  
2. The **source volume properties** (e.g., moment of inertia, angular velocity) change relative to the closed volume.  
3. The **closed system’s properties** (e.g., moment of inertia, angular velocity) change relative to the closed system itself.  This occures if the measured volume properties change.

Angular momentum is a property of volumes and their rotational motion, and its conservation depends on whether the volume is closed or open and whether its internal properties change.


### 3.7. Work and Energy Theorem: Framework Interpretation

# Traditional Statement
The **Work-Energy Theorem** states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy:
\[
W = \Delta KE
\]
Where:
- \( W \) is the work done on the object.
- \( \Delta KE \) is the change in kinetic energy.

# Framework Interpretation
In the framework, **work**, **kinetic energy**, and **potential energy** are reinterpreted as properties of **closed volumes**, and the **degradation factor** accounts for uncertainties and external influences. Here’s the refined breakdown:

# 1. Work as a Volume Interaction
   - **Traditional Definition**: Work is defined as the product of force and displacement (\( W = F \cdot d \)).
   - **Framework Definition**: Work is reinterpreted as an **interaction between volumes** (\( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \)), where:
     \[
     W = V_{\text{delta}} \cdot d
     \]
     - \( V_{\text{delta}} \): The volume interaction (replacing force).
     - \( d \): The displacement of the volume within the system.

# 2. Kinetic Energy as a Volume Property
   - **Traditional Definition**: Kinetic energy is defined as \( KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \).
   - **Framework Definition**: Kinetic energy is a property of a **closed volume** and depends on its mass (\( m \)) and velocity (\( v \)):
     \[
     KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
     \]
     - \( m \): Mass of the closed volume.
     - \( v \): Velocity of the closed volume.

# 3. Potential Energy as a Volume Property
   - **Traditional Definition**: Potential energy is defined as \( PE = m g h \) (gravitational) or \( PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \) (elastic).
   - **Framework Definition**: Potential energy is a property of a **closed volume** and depends on its configuration or position within a system:
     \[
     PE = f(V_{\text{config}})
     \]
     - \( V_{\text{config}} \): Configuration or position of the closed volume (e.g., height \( h \) for gravitational potential energy, displacement \( x \) for elastic potential energy).

# 4. Work-Energy Theorem in the Framework
   - The **Work-Energy Theorem** in the framework states that the work done by a volume interaction (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)) results in a change in the **kinetic energy** of the closed volume **or** a redefinition of the closed volume to allocate **potential energy** to multiple closed volumes:
     \[
     W = \Delta KE + \Delta PE
     \]
     - \( W \): Work done by the volume interaction.
     - \( \Delta KE \): Change in kinetic energy of the closed volume.
     - \( \Delta PE \): Change in potential energy due to redefinition of closed volumes.

# 5. Degradation Factor and Redefinition of Closed Volumes
   - When degradation thresholds are reached within a calculation, the closed volume must be **redefined**, and the energies within are allocated to the appropriate new closed volumes. This redefinition ensures that the system remains consistent despite external influences or uncertainties.
   - The **degradation factor** (\( D \)) is applied to both work and energy calculations:
     \[
     W_{\text{degraded}} = W \cdot D
     \]
     \[
     \Delta KE_{\text{degraded}} = \Delta KE \cdot D
     \]
     \[
     \Delta PE_{\text{degraded}} = \Delta PE \cdot D
     \]
     - \( D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}}) \): Degradation factor.
     - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
     - \( n \): Number of external references.
     - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.

# 6. Computational Thresholds and Degradation
   - The **degradation factor** also serves as a **computational threshold** to prevent overburdening systems. By limiting the precision of calculations through degradation, the framework avoids excessive computational complexity while maintaining realistic and meaningful results.
   - This approach ensures that the system remains computationally efficient, especially in scenarios involving cascading calculations or large-scale simulations.
   
### 3.8. Gravitational Potential Energy

#### Traditional Statement
The **Gravitational Potential Energy** of an object is given by:
\[
PE_{\text{grav}} = m g h
\]
Where:
- \( m \): Mass of the object.
- \( g \): Acceleration due to gravity.
- \( h \): Height of the object above a reference point.

---

#### Framework Interpretation
In the framework, **gravitational potential energy** is a property of a **closed volume** and depends on its mass, the gravitational field (\( g \)), and its position relative to **all mass centers** in the system. Here’s the refined breakdown:

---

### 1. Gravitational Potential Energy as a Volume Property
   - **Traditional Definition**: Gravitational potential energy is defined as \( PE_{\text{grav}} = m g h \).
   - **Framework Definition**: Gravitational potential energy is a property of a **closed volume** and depends on its mass (\( m \)), the gravitational field (\( g \)), and its position relative to **all mass centers** in the system:
     \[
     PE_{\text{grav}} = m \cdot g \cdot h_{\text{effective}}
     \]
     - \( m \): Mass of the closed volume.
     - \( g \): Gravitational field strength (a property of the system’s volume).
     - \( h_{\text{effective}} \): Effective height, calculated as the inverse square root of the relative distances from all mass centers.

---

### 2. Effective Height (\( h_{\text{effective}} \))
   - The **effective height** is not a simple vertical distance but a measure of the gravitational influence from **all mass centers** in the system. It is calculated as:
     \[
     h_{\text{effective}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum_{i} \frac{m_i}{r_i^2}}}
     \]
     - \( m_i \): Mass of the \( i \)-th mass center.
     - \( r_i \): Distance from the closed volume to the \( i \)-th mass center.
   - This formulation ensures that the gravitational potential energy accounts for the contributions of all masses in the system, not just the net center of mass.

---

### 3. Gravitational Field as a Volume Interaction
   - In the framework, the gravitational field (\( g \)) is reinterpreted as an **interaction between volumes**. The gravitational field strength at a point is determined by the net gravitational influence of all masses within the system:
     \[
     g = \sum_{i} \frac{G \cdot m_i}{r_i^2}
     \]
     - \( G \): Gravitational constant.
     - \( m_i \): Mass of the \( i \)-th mass center.
     - \( r_i \): Distance from the closed volume to the \( i \)-th mass center.

---

### 4. Degradation Factor in Gravitational Potential Energy
   - Since gravitational potential energy calculations may involve references to **open volumes** or **measuring volumes**, the **degradation factor** (\( D \)) must be applied to account for uncertainties:
     \[
     PE_{\text{grav, degraded}} = PE_{\text{grav}} \cdot D
     \]
     - \( D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}}) \): Degradation factor.
     - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
     - \( n \): Number of external references.
     - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.

---

### 5. Redefinition of Closed Volumes in Gravitational Systems
   - When degradation thresholds are reached within a gravitational system, the closed volume must be **redefined**, and the gravitational potential energy is allocated to the appropriate new closed volumes. This ensures that the system remains consistent despite external influences or uncertainties.
   - For example, if a closed volume is split into two new closed volumes (\( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \)), the gravitational potential energy is divided based on their masses and effective heights:
     \[
     PE_{\text{grav, V1}} = m_1 \cdot g \cdot h_{\text{effective, V1}}
     \]
     \[
     PE_{\text{grav, V2}} = m_2 \cdot g \cdot h_{\text{effective, V2}}
     \]
     - \( m_1, m_2 \): Masses of the new closed volumes.
     - \( h_{\text{effective, V1}}, h_{\text{effective, V2}} \): Effective heights of the new closed volumes.

### 3.9. Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

#### Traditional Definitions
- **Elastic Collision**: A collision where both **kinetic energy** and **momentum** are conserved.
- **Inelastic Collision**: A collision where **momentum** is conserved, but **kinetic energy** is not (some energy is converted into other forms, such as heat or deformation).

#### Framework Interpretation
In the framework, collisions are reinterpreted as **interactions between closed volumes**, where the **volume interaction** (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)) results in a redistribution of **kinetic** and **potential energies**. The **degradation factor** accounts for uncertainties and external influences. Here’s the refined breakdown:

### 1. Collisions as Volume Interactions
   - **Traditional Definition**: Collisions involve forces between objects that result in changes in their motion.
   - **Framework Definition**: Collisions are **interactions between closed volumes** (\( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \)), where the volume interaction (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)) results in a redistribution of **kinetic** and **potential energies** between the volumes.

### 2. Momentum Conservation in Collisions
   - **Traditional Definition**: Momentum is conserved in all collisions:
     \[
     m_1 v_{1, \text{initial}} + m_2 v_{2, \text{initial}} = m_1 v_{1, \text{final}} + m_2 v_{2, \text{final}}
     \]
   - **Framework Definition**: Momentum conservation is reinterpreted as the conservation of **volume energies** within **volume interactions**:
     \[
     m_1 v_{1, \text{initial}} + m_2 v_{2, \text{initial}} = m_1 v_{1, \text{final}} + m_2 v_{2, \text{final}}
     \]
     - \( m_1, m_2 \): Masses of the closed volumes.
     - \( v_{1, \text{initial}}, v_{2, \text{initial}} \): Initial velocities of the closed volumes.
     - \( v_{1, \text{final}}, v_{2, \text{final}} \): Final velocities of the closed volumes.

### 3. Elastic and Inelastic Energy Transfer
   - **Framework Definition**: Collisions result in both **elastic** and **inelastic** energy transfer via the **volume interaction** (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)). The interaction redistributes energy between the closed volumes by redefining **kinetic** and **potential energies** at each step:
     - **Elastic Energy Transfer**: Kinetic energy is conserved and redistributed between the volumes.
     - **Inelastic Energy Transfer**: Some kinetic energy is converted into **potential energy** (e.g., deformation, heat) or **entropic variables** (unobserved interactions).

### 4. Energy Redistribution in Collisions
   - **Framework Definition**: The **volume interaction** (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)) results in a redistribution of energy between the closed volumes:
     \[
     KE_{\text{initial}} + PE_{\text{initial}} = KE_{\text{final}} + PE_{\text{final}} + \Delta V_{\text{entropic}}
     \]
     - \( KE_{\text{initial}}, KE_{\text{final}} \): Initial and final kinetic energies.
     - \( PE_{\text{initial}}, PE_{\text{final}} \): Initial and final potential energies.
     - \( \Delta V_{\text{entropic}} \): Change in entropic variables (unobserved interactions).

### 5. Degradation Factor in Collisions
   - Since collisions may involve references to **open volumes** or **measuring volumes**, the **degradation factor** (\( D \)) must be applied to account for uncertainties:

     KE_{\text{final, degraded}} = KE_{\text{final}} \cdot D
     \]
     \[
     PE_{\text{final, degraded}} = PE_{\text{final}} \cdot D
     \]

     - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
     - \( n \): Number of external references.
     - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.

### 3.10. Centripetal Force and Circular Motion

- **Circular Motion**: The motion of an object along a circular path, maintained by centripetal force.

#### Framework Interpretation
In the framework, **circular motion** is primarily a function of **potential energy observation**, where the **volume interaction** (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)) provides the necessary inward force to maintain the motion. Any **kinetic energy injection** (e.g., orbital adjustments or flywheel motion) involves **elasticity** in kinetic transfer and is subject to **degradation** due to **entropic variables**. Here’s the refined breakdown:

### 1. Circular Motion as Potential Energy Observation
   - **Traditional Definition**: Circular motion is maintained by centripetal force, which keeps the object moving along a curved path.
   - **Framework Definition**: Circular motion is a function of **potential energy observation**, where the **volume interaction** (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)) provides the inward force necessary to maintain the motion.

     - \( m \): Mass of the closed volume.
     - \( v \): Velocity of the closed volume.
     - \( r \): Radius of the circular path.

### 3. Kinetic Energy Injection and Elasticity
   - **Framework Definition**: If **kinetic energy** is injected into the system (e.g., to adjust an orbit or increase flywheel speed), the motion adjustment is a function of **elasticity** within the kinetic transfer to the closed volume. The elasticity determines how efficiently the kinetic energy is transferred and redistributed.
   - **Elasticity in Kinetic Transfer**:
     - In an **elastic system**, kinetic energy is fully transferred and redistributed without loss.
     - In an **inelastic system**, some kinetic energy is converted into **potential energy** or **entropic variables**.

### 4. Degradation in Circular Motion
   - **Framework Definition**: Over time, circular motion degrades due to **entropic variables** (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)), which represent unobserved interactions or energy losses. This degradation is particularly evident in systems like flywheels or orbital adjustments, where kinetic energy is slowly lost to external influences.
   - **Degradation Factor**:
     \[
     V_{\text{delta, degraded}} = V_{\text{delta}} \cdot D
     \]
     \[
     KE_{\text{degraded}} = KE \cdot D
     \]

     - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
     - \( n \): Number of external references.
     - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.
	 
### 3.11. Torque and Rotational Dynamics

#### Traditional Definitions

  \[
  \tau = r \times F
  \]

  - \( F \): Force applied.
- **Rotational Dynamics**: The study of the motion of objects that rotate, including concepts like angular momentum, moment of inertia, and rotational kinetic energy.

---

     \[
     \tau = r \times F
     \]
   - **Framework Definition**: Torque is reinterpreted as a **volume interaction** (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)) that provides the rotational force necessary to cause rotation:

     - \( V_{\text{delta}} \): Volume interaction (replacing force).

---

### 2. Rotational Dynamics as Volume Interactions

       \]
       - \( PE_{\text{rot}} \): Rotational potential energy (within the closed volume).

---

### 3. Degradation Factor in Rotational Dynamics
   - Since rotational dynamics may involve references to **open volumes** or **measuring volumes**, the **degradation factor** (\( D \)) must be applied to account for uncertainties:

### 3.12. Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) in the Framework

#### Traditional Definition
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement. It is typically described by the equation:
\[
F = -kx
\]
Where:
- \( F \) is the restoring force.
- \( k \) is the spring constant (a measure of stiffness).
- \( x \) is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

The motion is sinusoidal in time and can be described by:
\[
x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
\]
Where:
- \( A \) is the amplitude of the motion.
- \( \omega \) is the angular frequency.
- \( \phi \) is the phase angle.

#### Framework Interpretation
In the framework, **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)** is reinterpreted as a **kinetic energy injection** into a **closed volume**, followed by a **potential energy oscillation** **hinged from a point of origin** that is offset from the **net center of mass** of the system. The oscillation is maintained by the **redistribution of potential energy** within the closed volume, or, if needed, by **recalculating the closed volume into two volumes** to resolve the need to track specific energy paths. The **degradation factor** accounts for energy losses due to entropic variables.

### 1. Kinetic Energy Injection
- **Traditional Definition**: In SHM, energy is initially injected into the system, typically by displacing the object from its equilibrium position.
- **Framework Definition**: In the framework, the **kinetic energy injection** is the initial energy input that sets the closed volume into motion. This energy is stored as **kinetic energy** within the closed volume and is later converted into **potential energy** as the system oscillates.

### 2. Potential Energy Oscillation
- **Traditional Definition**: The potential energy in SHM is given by:
  \[
  PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
  \]
  Where \( k \) is the spring constant and \( x \) is the displacement.
- **Framework Definition**: In the framework, the **potential energy oscillation** is a result of the **kinetic energy** being converted into **potential energy** as the closed volume moves away from the equilibrium position. The potential energy is **hinged from a point of origin** and is a function of the **volume interaction** (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)) and the displacement (\( x \)):
  \[
  PE = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{delta}} \cdot x^2
  \]
  - \( V_{\text{delta}} \): Volume interaction (replacing the spring constant \( k \)).
  - \( x \): Displacement from the point of origin.

### 3. Point of Origin Offset from Net Center of Mass
- **Traditional Definition**: In SHM, the equilibrium position is typically the point where the net force is zero.
- **Framework Definition**: In the framework, the **point of origin** is offset from the **net center of mass** of the closed volume. This offset creates a restoring force that drives the oscillation. The restoring force is a result of the **volume interaction** (\( V_{\text{delta}} \)) and the displacement (\( x \)):
  \[
  F_{\text{restore}} = -V_{\text{delta}} \cdot x
  \]
  - \( F_{\text{restore}} \): Restoring force.
  - \( V_{\text{delta}} \): Volume interaction.
  - \( x \): Displacement from the point of origin.

### 4. Redistribution of Potential Energy
- **Framework Definition**: The oscillation is maintained by the **redistribution of potential energy** within the closed volume. If the system becomes too complex to track energy paths within a single closed volume, the framework allows for the **recalculation of the closed volume into two volumes**. This recalibration ensures that specific energy paths can be tracked accurately, and the system remains consistent.

### 5. Degradation Factor in SHM
- **Framework Definition**: Over time, the oscillation in SHM degrades due to **entropic variables** (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)), which represent unobserved interactions or energy losses. This degradation is particularly evident in real-world systems where energy is lost to friction, air resistance, or other external influences.
  - The **degradation factor** (\( D \)) is applied to both the kinetic and potential energy calculations:
    \[
    KE_{\text{degraded}} = KE \cdot D
    \]
    \[
    PE_{\text{degraded}} = PE \cdot D
    \]
    - \( D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}}) \): Degradation factor.
    - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
    - \( n \): Number of external references.
    - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.
