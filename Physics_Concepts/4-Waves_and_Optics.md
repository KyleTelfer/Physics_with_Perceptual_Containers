## 5. Waves and Optics

### 5.1. Energy Waveforms

#### Framework Overview
In the framework, **all waveforms**—whether sound waves, light waves, or other electromagnetic waves—are reinterpreted as **energy oscillations** moving through **3D space**. These oscillations are not limited to any single physical space at once, meaning that waveforms exist as **energy transfers** within or between **closed volumes**. 

- **Energy Oscillations**: Waveforms are energy oscillations that propagate through 3D space, either within a single closed volume or between multiple closed volumes.
- **Potential Energy**: Energy within a **closed volume** is treated as **potential energy**, where the waveform’s properties (e.g., wavelength, frequency, amplitude) are determined by the volume’s internal energy distribution.
- **Kinetic Energy**: Energy transfer between two or more closed volumes is treated as **kinetic energy**, where the waveform’s propagation is governed by the interaction between the volumes.

#### Key Concepts
1. **Wave Properties (Wavelength, Frequency, Amplitude)**:
   - **Wavelength (\( \lambda \))**: Represents the spatial distribution of energy within a closed volume.
   - **Frequency (\( f \))**: Represents the temporal distribution of energy within a closed volume.
   - **Amplitude (\( A \))**: Represents the maximum energy displacement within a closed volume.

2. **Sound Waves and Doppler Effect**:
   - **Sound Waves**: Energy oscillations within a closed volume (e.g., air) that propagate as compressions and rarefactions.
   - **Doppler Effect**: A frequency shift observed due to relative motion between the source and the observer, dependent on the **observer’s perspective**.

3. **Light Waves and Electromagnetic Spectrum**:
   - **Light Waves**: Energy oscillations within the **theoretical 3D space open volume**, where electric and magnetic fields are reinterpreted as **volume interactions**.
   - **Electromagnetic Spectrum**: A classification of energy oscillations based on their frequency and wavelength within the open volume.

#### Mathematical Representation
- **Wave Velocity**:
  \[
  v = \lambda \cdot f
  \]
  Where:
  - \( v \): Wave velocity (a property of the closed volume or open volume).
  - \( \lambda \): Wavelength.
  - \( f \): Frequency.

- **Doppler Effect**:
  \[
  f' = f \left( \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} \right)
  \]
  Where:
  - \( f' \): Observed frequency.
  - \( f \): Emitted frequency.
  - \( v \): Wave velocity in the medium.
  - \( v_o \): Velocity of the observer relative to the medium.
  - \( v_s \): Velocity of the source relative to the medium.

- **Electromagnetic Waves**:
  \[
  c = \lambda \cdot f
  \]
  Where:
  - \( c \): Speed of light in a vacuum (a constant within the open volume).
  - \( \lambda \): Wavelength.
  - \( f \): Frequency.

#### Energy Transfers in Waveforms
- **Potential Energy**: Energy within a **closed volume** is treated as **potential energy**, where the waveform’s properties are determined by the volume’s internal energy distribution. For example, the amplitude of a sound wave in a closed room represents the potential energy stored in the air molecules.
- **Kinetic Energy**: Energy transfer between two or more closed volumes is treated as **kinetic energy**, where the waveform’s propagation is governed by the interaction between the volumes. For example, light waves traveling between two closed volumes (e.g., from the sun to Earth) represent kinetic energy transfer.

#### Degradation Factor in Waveforms
Over time, waveforms degrade due to **entropic variables** (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)), which represent unobserved interactions or energy losses. This degradation is particularly evident in real-world systems where energy is lost to friction, absorption, or other external influences. The **degradation factor** (\( D \)) is applied to account for these losses:
\[
E_{\text{degraded}} = E \cdot D
\]
Where:
- \( E \): Energy of the waveform.
- \( D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}}) \): Degradation factor.
- \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
- \( n \): Number of external references.
- \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.

### 5.2. Reflection, Refraction, and Diffraction

#### Traditional Definition
- **Reflection**: The bouncing back of a wave when it encounters a boundary.
- **Refraction**: The bending of a wave as it passes from one medium to another.
- **Diffraction**: The spreading out of a wave as it passes through an opening or around an obstacle.

#### Framework Interpretation
In the framework, **reflection**, **refraction**, and **diffraction** are reinterpreted as **energy redistributions** within or between closed volumes. These phenomena occur due to changes in the **volume interactions** and the **observer’s perspective**. All interactions are subject to the **elasticity** of the energy transfer and the **compounding degradation of variables**.

- **Reflection**: Energy redistribution within a closed volume when the wave encounters a boundary. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. The **elasticity** of the interaction determines how efficiently the energy is reflected, while the **degradation factor** accounts for energy losses.
- **Refraction**: Energy redistribution when a wave passes from one closed volume to another, resulting in a change in wave velocity and direction. The **elasticity** of the interaction determines how efficiently the energy is refracted, and the **degradation factor** accounts for energy losses during the transition.
- **Diffraction**: Energy redistribution within a closed volume when the wave encounters an obstacle or opening, causing the wave to spread out. The **elasticity** of the interaction determines how efficiently the energy is diffracted, and the **degradation factor** accounts for energy losses due to the spreading.

#### Mathematical Representation
- **Reflection**:
  \[
  \theta_i = \theta_r
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \theta_i \): Angle of incidence.
  - \( \theta_r \): Angle of reflection.

- **Refraction**:
  \[
  \frac{\sin \theta_i}{\sin \theta_r} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \theta_i \): Angle of incidence.
  - \( \theta_r \): Angle of refraction.
  - \( v_1 \): Wave velocity in the first medium.
  - \( v_2 \): Wave velocity in the second medium.

- **Diffraction**:
  \[
  \sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{d}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \theta \): Angle of diffraction.
  - \( \lambda \): Wavelength.
  - \( d \): Size of the opening or obstacle.

#### Elasticity and Degradation
- **Elasticity**: The efficiency of energy transfer during reflection, refraction, or diffraction is determined by the **elasticity** of the interaction. In an **elastic interaction**, energy is fully redistributed without loss. In an **inelastic interaction**, some energy is converted into **potential energy** or **entropic variables**.
- **Degradation**: The **degradation factor** (\( D \)) accounts for energy losses due to **entropic variables** (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)) and external references:
  \[
  E_{\text{degraded}} = E \cdot D
  \]
  Where:
  - \( E \): Energy of the wave.
  - \( D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}}) \): Degradation factor.
  - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
  - \( n \): Number of external references.
  - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.

- **Optical Phenomena**:
  - **Dispersion**: Energy redistribution within a closed volume, where different wavelengths (energies) are refracted at different angles. The **elasticity** of the interaction determines how efficiently the energy is dispersed, and the **degradation factor** accounts for energy losses.

This approach reinforces the framework’s core principles, where **potential energy** is tied to a **closed volume** and **kinetic energy** is tied to **energy transfer between volumes**. The **degradation factor** ensures that the framework accurately reflects real-world complexities, such as energy losses due to entropic variables.
