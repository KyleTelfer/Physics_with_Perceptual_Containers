### 10.0. Quantum Mechanics in the Framework

#### 10.1. **Wave-Particle Duality**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - **Wave**: Kinetic energy in a state of traversal (energy moving through a volume).
  - **Particle**: Potential energy observation within a receiver (energy localized within a volume).
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - The wave-like behavior represents **kinetic energy transfer** between volumes.
  - The particle-like behavior represents **potential energy** observed when energy is localized within a specific volume.
  - The duality could be seen as a **redefinition of the closed volume** depending on whether the energy is in motion (wave) or at rest (particle).

#### 10.2. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - A paradox in logic: momentum doesn’t exist in a still photo, so quantifying position loses momentum.
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - The act of measuring position (a still photo) inherently disrupts the system, introducing **entropic variables** that degrade the ability to measure momentum.
  - The uncertainty principle could be seen as a **degradation factor** introduced by the observer’s interaction with the system.

---

#### 10.3. **Schrödinger’s Equation**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - A conversion to inverse square root from a point of influence.
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - The Schrödinger equation could describe **energy redistribution** within a closed volume, where the wave function (\( \psi \)) represents the energy distribution.
  - The inverse square root might represent the **decay of influence** from a point of origin (e.g., the nucleus in an atom).

---

#### 10.4. **Quantum Superposition and Entanglement**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - Superposition: Taking many volumes and comparing them regardless of like conditions in regards to energy contributions within each.
  - Entanglement: A shared volume interaction, where two or more volumes are part of the same closed system.
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - **Superposition**: Represents multiple potential energy states within a single closed volume. The system exists in a superposition until an observation collapses it into a single state.
  - **Entanglement**: Two or more volumes share a **volume interaction**, keeping their energy states correlated even if separated.

---

#### 10.5. **Quantum Tunneling**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - A closing of a volume and a potential energy calculation. The perception of a volume’s quantified energy doesn’t have to be within a single continuous physical space.
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - Quantum tunneling could be reinterpreted as a **redefinition of the closed volume**. The particle’s energy is redistributed in such a way that it "appears" on the other side of a barrier, even though classically it shouldn’t be able to.

---

#### 10.6. **Blackbody Radiation and Planck’s Law**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - More volume-dependent energy transfer calculations.
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - Blackbody radiation could be seen as **kinetic energy transfer** between closed volumes, where energy is redistributed as electromagnetic waves.
  - Planck’s law might describe how energy is **quantized** within these volume interactions.

---

#### 10.7. **Photoelectric Effect**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - A kinetic EMF interaction with volume charge.
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - The photoelectric effect could be reinterpreted as a **volume interaction** between the photon (a closed volume of energy) and the electron (another closed volume).
  - The ejection of the electron is a result of the **energy transfer** between these volumes.

---

#### 10.8. **Atomic Models (Bohr Model, Quantum Model)**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - An attempt to define energy/mass thresholds described as possible elements in the model. The larger the mass, the more complex the charged shell.
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - The Bohr model’s discrete energy levels could represent **stable energy configurations** within a closed volume.
  - The quantum model’s orbitals might represent **potential energy distributions** within the volume, with the electron’s position determined by volume interactions.

---

#### 10.9. **Quantum Decoherence**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - Degradation with a major flaw: the rules of observance within a given system depend on whether the field itself needs to be unobserved to be redefined. Partial observance influences the inability for unobserved parts to recover to the natural mechanic.
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - Decoherence could be modeled as a **degradation factor** due to entropic variables introduced by the environment.
  - The interaction with the environment causes the system to transition from a **quantum state** (multiple potential energy distributions) to a **classical state** (single defined energy interaction).

---

#### 10.10. **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**
- **Your Interpretation**:
  - QFT might just fit into the model as it already is.
- **Framework Alignment**:
  - QFT could be reinterpreted in terms of **volume interactions** and **energy redistributions**.
  - Fields might represent **energy distributions** within a closed volume, and particles could be seen as **localized energy interactions** between volumes.
