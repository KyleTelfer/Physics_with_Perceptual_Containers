### 11.1. **Big Bang as a Black Hole Explosion**

#### Core Idea
- **Big Bang as Black Hole Explosion**: The Big Bang can be reinterpreted as the explosion of a black hole structure, where the mass and energy within the black hole (closed volume) are discharged outward, leading to the expansion of the universe.
- **Orbiting Mass**: The mass orbiting the black hole could have been ejected during the explosion, contributing to the initial distribution of matter in the universe.
- **Dark Energy**: The energy released during the black hole explosion could drive the accelerated expansion of the universe, providing an alternative explanation for dark energy.

#### Framework Interpretation

1. **Black Hole Explosion**:
   - The Big Bang can be seen as a **volume interaction** within the black hole (closed volume), where the mass and energy are discharged outward, leading to the expansion of the universe.
   - The **degradation factor** (\( D \)) can be applied to account for energy losses during the explosion.

2. **Orbiting Mass**:
   - The mass orbiting the black hole could have been ejected during the explosion, contributing to the initial distribution of matter in the universe. This can be modeled as a **volume interaction** where energy is redistributed to form galaxies, clusters, and the cosmic web.

3. **Dark Energy**:
   - Is to me is either the sum of entropic variables, entropic relativity.  The need for mass to exist for the formation of the current observed structures within our observable space is a different issue as the mass per volume value for all observable space might just be equal to the mass missing and the relativity of the way we measure mass would be just an entropic adjustment for this value.

#### Mathematical Representation

1. **Energy Released During Explosion**:
   - The energy released during the black hole explosion can be modeled as:
     \[
     E_{\text{explosion}} = M_{\text{BH}} \cdot c^2
     \]
     Where:
     - \( E_{\text{explosion}} \): Energy released during the explosion.
     - \( M_{\text{BH}} \): Mass of the black hole.
     - \( c \): Speed of light.

2. **Per-Volume Mass Density for Structure Formation**:
   - The **critical density** (\( \rho_{\text{crit}} \)) required for gravitational collapse and structure formation can be calculated as:
     \[
     \rho_{\text{crit}} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G}
     \]
     Where:
     - \( \rho_{\text{crit}} \): Critical density of the universe.
     - \( H_0 \): Hubble constant.
     - \( G \): Gravitational constant.

   - The **per-volume mass density** (\( \rho_{\text{vol}} \)) needed for structure formation can be adjusted based on the observed distribution of matter:
     \[
     \rho_{\text{vol}} = \rho_{\text{crit}} \cdot \Omega_m
     \]
     Where:
     - \( \Omega_m \): Density parameter for matter (observed value: ~0.3).

#### Example: Per-Volume Mass Adjustment

- **Scenario**: Calculate the **per-volume mass density** needed for large-scale structure formation in a universe with \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \) and \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \).
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \rho_{\text{crit}} = \frac{3 (70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc})^2}{8 \pi G} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3
  \]
  \[
  \rho_{\text{vol}} = \rho_{\text{crit}} \cdot 0.3 \approx 2.8 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3
  \]
- **Interpretation**: The **per-volume mass density** needed for structure formation is approximately \( 2.8 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3 \). This value can be adjusted based on the observed distribution of matter in the universe.

### Reflection on Big Bang as a Black Hole Explosion

- **Volume Interactions**: The explosion of a black hole and the subsequent expansion of the universe can be modeled as **volume interactions** within the universe (closed volume), where energy is redistributed over time.
- **Observer Dependence**: The observed properties of the universe (e.g., expansion, structure) depend on the **relative positions** of matter and energy, aligning with your framework's principle of **observer dependence**.
- **Degradation Factor**: The **degradation factor** (\( D \)) can be applied to account for energy losses and uncertainties in the black hole explosion and structure formation processes, ensuring consistency with real-world observations.
