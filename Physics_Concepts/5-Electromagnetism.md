## 5. Electromagnetism

### 5.1. Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law

#### Traditional Definition
- **Electric Field (\( \vec{E} \))**: A region around a charged particle where other charged particles experience a force.
- **Coulomb’s Law**: Describes the force between two charged particles:
  \[
  F = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( F \): Force between the charges.
  - \( k_e \): Coulomb’s constant.
  - \( q_1, q_2 \): Charges of the particles.
  - \( r \): Distance between the charges.

#### Framework Interpretation
In the framework, **electric fields** and **Coulomb’s Law** are reinterpreted as **energy interactions** between **closed volumes** containing charges. The electric field is a manifestation of the **volume interaction** between charged volumes, and the force is a result of the energy redistribution between these volumes.

- **Electric Field**: Represents the **energy distribution** around a charged closed volume. The field strength depends on the charge and the properties of the closed volume.
- **Coulomb’s Law**: Describes the **energy interaction** between two charged closed volumes. The force is a result of the energy redistribution between the volumes.

#### Mathematical Representation
- **Electric Field**:
  \[
  \vec{E} = \frac{F}{q} = k_e \frac{q}{r^2}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \vec{E} \): Electric field.
  - \( F \): Force.
  - \( q \): Test charge.
  - \( k_e \): Coulomb’s constant.
  - \( r \): Distance from the charge.

- **Coulomb’s Law**:
  \[
  F = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( F \): Force between the charges.
  - \( k_e \): Coulomb’s constant.
  - \( q_1, q_2 \): Charges of the particles.
  - \( r \): Distance between the charges.

#### Elasticity and Degradation
- **Elasticity**: The efficiency of energy transfer between charged volumes is determined by the **elasticity** of the interaction. In an **elastic interaction**, energy is fully redistributed without loss. In an **inelastic interaction**, some energy is converted into **potential energy** or **entropic variables**.
- **Degradation**: The **degradation factor** (\( D \)) accounts for energy losses due to **entropic variables** (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)) and external references:
  \[
  F_{\text{degraded}} = F \cdot D
  \]
  Where:
  - \( F \): Force between the charges.
  - \( D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}}) \): Degradation factor.
  - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
  - \( n \): Number of external references.
  - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.

### 5.2. Magnetic Fields and Lorentz Force

#### Traditional Definition
- **Magnetic Field (\( \vec{B} \))**: A region around a magnet or moving charge where other moving charges experience a force.
- **Lorentz Force**: Describes the force on a charged particle moving in an electric and magnetic field:
  \[
  \vec{F} = q (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \vec{F} \): Force on the particle.
  - \( q \): Charge of the particle.
  - \( \vec{E} \): Electric field.
  - \( \vec{v} \): Velocity of the particle.
  - \( \vec{B} \): Magnetic field.

#### Framework Interpretation
In the framework, **magnetic fields** are a result of the **physical properties** of a volume. The magnetic field is a **property of the volume**, defined by the configuration of the volume’s matter. However, a **static magnetic field** (one that is not changing or interacting with other volumes) cannot achieve **kinetic energy transfer** on its own. Kinetic transfer via a magnetic field requires either:

1. **Injection of Kinetic Energy**: An external energy source (e.g., a moving charge or changing electric field) must interact with the magnetic field to induce kinetic transfer.
2. **Interaction Between Closed Volumes**: Kinetic transfer occurs when two closed volumes interact via their magnetic fields, and the energy is calculated through a **third closed volume** or a **measured open volume**.

- **Magnetic Field**: Represents the **energy distribution** around a volume, determined by the configuration of the volume’s matter. The field strength depends on the volume’s composition and the arrangement of its charged particles.
- **Lorentz Force**: Describes the **energy interaction** between a moving charged closed volume and an external electric or magnetic field. The force is a result of the energy redistribution between the volumes.

#### Key Idea: Static vs. Dynamic Magnetic Fields
- **Static Magnetic Field**: A magnetic field that is not changing or interacting with other volumes will reach **equilibrium** and will not transfer energy. In this state, the magnetic field is a **potential energy configuration** within the volume. However, the volume itself (and thus the magnetic field) may be **moving** (e.g., due to the motion of the volume). To calculate the energy transfer or interactions, the volumes must be **redefined** to account for the relative motion or changes in configuration.
- **Dynamic Magnetic Field**: A magnetic field that is changing or interacting with other volumes (e.g., through motion or external energy injection) can achieve **kinetic energy transfer**. This transfer is mediated by the interaction between the volumes and is subject to the **elasticity** and **degradation** of the interaction.

#### Mathematical Representation
- **Magnetic Field**:
  \[
  \vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \vec{B} \): Magnetic field.
  - \( \mu_0 \): Permeability of free space.
  - \( q \): Charge of the particle.
  - \( \vec{v} \): Velocity of the particle.
  - \( \hat{r} \): Unit vector in the direction of \( r \).
  - \( r \): Distance from the charge.

- **Lorentz Force**:
  \[
  \vec{F} = q (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \vec{F} \): Force on the particle.
  - \( q \): Charge of the particle.
  - \( \vec{E} \): Electric field.
  - \( \vec{v} \): Velocity of the particle.
  - \( \vec{B} \): Magnetic field.

#### Elasticity and Degradation
- **Elasticity**: The efficiency of energy transfer between moving charged volumes is determined by the **elasticity** of the interaction. In an **elastic interaction**, energy is fully redistributed without loss. In an **inelastic interaction**, some energy is converted into **potential energy** or **entropic variables**.
- **Degradation**: The **degradation factor** (\( D \)) accounts for energy losses due to **entropic variables** (\( V_{\text{entropic}} \)) and external references:
  \[
  \vec{F}_{\text{degraded}} = \vec{F} \cdot D
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \vec{F} \): Force on the particle.
  - \( D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}}) \): Degradation factor.
  - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
  - \( n \): Number of external references.
  - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.

### 5.3. Electromagnetic Induction

#### Traditional Definition
- **Electromagnetic Induction**: The process of generating an electric current in a conductor by changing the magnetic field around it.
- **Faraday’s Law**: Describes the induced electromotive force (EMF):
  \[
  \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \mathcal{E} \): Induced EMF.
  - \( \Phi_B \): Magnetic flux.

#### Framework Interpretation
In the framework, **electromagnetic induction** is reinterpreted as **energy redistribution** within a closed volume due to changes in the **magnetic field**. The induced EMF is a result of the **volume interaction** between the changing magnetic field and the closed volume.

### Conclusion
By refining the interpretation of **magnetic fields** within the framework, we emphasize that **kinetic energy transfer** via a magnetic field requires either an **external energy source** or an **interaction between closed volumes**. A **static magnetic field** will reach equilibrium and cannot transfer energy on its own, even if the volume itself is moving. To calculate energy transfer or interactions, the volumes must be **redefined** to account for relative motion or changes in configuration. This approach ensures that the framework accurately reflects real-world complexities and provides a consistent way to model electromagnetic behavior within closed volumes and open 3D space.
