# src Directory

## Description
This directory contains Python code and mathematical resolutions for the **Volume Interaction Framework**. The code is organized into first-person, second-person, and third-person narrative viewpoints, ensuring that calculations respect the framework's principles.

## Key Concepts
- **Volume Interactions**: How the code implements interactions between volumes.
- **Degradation Factors**: How computational thresholds are applied in the code.
- **Observer-Dependence**: How different observer perspectives are represented in the code.

## Directory Structure
- **1st_Person**: Code written from the first-person perspective.
- **2nd_Person**: Code written from the second-person perspective.
- **3rd_Person**: Code written from the third-person perspective.
- **Volume_interaction_workflows**: Workflows for volume interactions.

## How to Use This Directory
1. **Start with the Framework Overview**: If you're new to the Volume Interaction Framework, begin with the [Framework Overview](../Framework_Overview/1-Legend.md) to understand the core principles and notation.
2. **Explore Specific Code**: Navigate to the specific subdirectories (e.g., 1st_Person, 2nd_Person) to see how the framework is implemented in code.
3. **Cross-Reference with Physics Concepts**: The physics concepts behind the code can be found in the [Physics Concepts](../Physics_Concepts) directory.
