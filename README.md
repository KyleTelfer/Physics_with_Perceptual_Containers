## Description
This repository is a collection of physics ideas and a framework for simulating and analyzing physical systems. The framework reinterprets traditional physics concepts (e.g., Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism) through the lens of **container interactions** and **observer-dependent measurements**. The goal is to provide a platform for exploring theoretical and computational physics in a structured and modular way.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Container Interactions
- Forces and interactions are reinterpreted as interactions between containers.
- While respecting container interactions limits open, closed, or even partially defined containers exist but the interactions between containers is better managed within scope if a container is in theory denoted.

### 2. Observer-Dependence
- Measurements depend on the observer’s perspective.
- **First-Person**: Measurements from your perspective.
- **Second-Person**: Measurements from another observer’s perspective.
- **Third-Person**: Absolute measurements independent of observers.

### 3. Degradation Factor
- Accounts for uncertainties in calculations due to external references and internal entropic variables.
- Mathematical representation:
  \[
  D = 1 - (k \cdot n + V_{\text{entropic}})
  \]
  - \( k \): Degradation per external reference.
  - \( n \): Number of external references.
  - \( V_{\text{entropic}} \): Entropic contribution to degradation.

## Framework Applications
The framework can be applied to various workflows, including:
1b.1 Computerized Modeling : Theoretical simulations using computational tools to predict system behavior.
1b.2 Theoretical Viability (Mind Boxing) : Exploring conceptual feasibility through thought experiments and theoretical analysis.
1b.3 Engineering Development/Prototyping : Designing and building prototypes to assess the practicality of a system.
1b.4 Rigor/Failure Testing : Subjecting the system to rigorous testing to identify failure points and validate performance.

### Example: Computerized Modeling
- **Purpose**: Explore "what-if" scenarios, optimize designs, or identify trends.
- **Challenges**: Limited by computational resources, model accuracy, and input data quality.
- **Framework Application**: Use degradation factors to account for uncertainties in the model.
